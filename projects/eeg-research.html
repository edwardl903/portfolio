                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>I had the incredible opportunity to contribute to a published research study that explored how consumer-grade EEG devices could detect different cognitive states. The study was titled "Neural Signatures Within and Between Chess Puzzle Solving and Standard Cognitive Tasks for Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Low-Cost Electroencephalography Study" - quite a mouthful! We used the MUSE 2 headband (a consumer EEG device) to see if we could distinguish between different types of thinking tasks, including chess puzzles, memory games, and visual rotation tasks.</p>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <h2>What I Did</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Helped Design the Study:</strong> I worked with the team to figure out how to structure the experiments and what tasks would best test different types of thinking</li>
                        <li><strong>Collected Data:</strong> I helped run participants through the experiments, making sure they wore the MUSE 2 headband correctly and completed all the cognitive tasks</li>
                        <li><strong>Did the Math:</strong> I contributed to the statistical analysis, using linear mixed-effects models to see if we could reliably distinguish between different cognitive states</li>
                        <li><strong>Made Visualizations:</strong> I created charts and graphs to help everyone understand what the brain activity data was telling us</li>
                        <li><strong>Built ML Models:</strong> I helped implement machine learning models that could predict what type of cognitive task someone was doing based on their brain activity</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <h2>How We Did It</h2>

                        <div class="arch-item">
                            <h3>Mixed Up the Tasks</h3>
                            <p>We combined classic cognitive tests (like memory games and color-word matching) with chess puzzles to see how different types of thinking showed up in brain activity</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="arch-item">
                            <h3>Used a Cool Headband</h3>
                            <p>The MUSE 2 is basically a fancy headband that reads brain waves - much cheaper than lab EEG equipment but surprisingly effective!</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="arch-item">
                            <h3>Crunched the Numbers</h3>
                            <p>We used linear mixed-effects models to tease out patterns in the brain activity data and see if we could reliably tell different cognitive states apart</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="arch-item">
                            <h3>Taught Computers to Read Minds</h3>

                    <h2>The Technical Stuff</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cleaned Up the Brain Data:</strong> EEG signals are messy! I helped filter out noise and extract the meaningful brain activity patterns from the MUSE 2 recordings</li>
                        <li><strong>Found Patterns in the Chaos:</strong> Using linear mixed-effects models, we figured out how to reliably distinguish between different types of thinking based on brain activity</li>
                        <li><strong>Made Pretty Pictures:</strong> I created visualizations that made the complex brain activity data actually understandable and presentable</li>
                        <li><strong>Built Brain-Reading AI:</strong> We trained machine learning models that could predict whether someone was doing memory tasks, chess puzzles, or other cognitive activities</li>
                        <li><strong>Proved It Actually Works:</strong> We rigorously tested everything to make sure our findings were solid and reproducible</li>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <h2>What We Discovered</h2>
                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h3>The Headband Actually Works!</h3>
                        <p>We were surprised to find that the MUSE 2 (a relatively cheap consumer device) could reliably tell the difference between different types of thinking and cognitive workload levels.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This means we could potentially build brain-computer interfaces that adapt to your thinking in real-time, without needing expensive lab equipment!</p>

                    <div class="challenge-item">
                        <h3>Our AI Could Read Minds (Sort Of)</h3>
                        <p>We successfully built machine learning models that could predict what type of cognitive task someone was doing based on their brain activity patterns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This opens up possibilities for adaptive systems that respond to your cognitive state - imagine a computer that knows when you're focused vs. distracted!</p>
