                    <h2>Introduction: Curiosity, Strategy, and a Chessboard</h2>
                    <p>Before I ever wrote a single SQL query or processed a dataset, I was just a chess player trying to understand why I kept losing the same types of games.</p>
                    
                    <p>It started like this: I'd play five games online. Win two, lose three. I'd feel like I was doing okay—until I checked my history and noticed I had lost to the exact same opening… again. That pattern repeated itself over weeks, and I began wondering whether there was something deeper going on. Was I making predictable mistakes? Was my intuition failing me under time pressure?</p>
                    
                    <p>This question—<strong>what am I missing?</strong>—sparked the creation of ChessLytics, a data analytics platform that helps players make sense of their chess performance by combining large-scale game processing with behavioral insights. What started as a small personal project eventually became a full data pipeline analyzing thousands of games, complete with automated dashboards, user-specific reports, and scalable cloud architecture.</p>
                    
                    <p>While I built ChessLytics to improve at chess, I ended up learning how to build real-world data systems, work with messy and complex datasets, and think critically about user behavior. It taught me more than any classroom project. And more importantly, it taught me how to connect data with decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Identifying the Problem: Beyond the Game History</h2>
                    <p>Platforms like Chess.com do a great job of letting users review their games. But those reviews are usually one-off. They show what happened in a single game, but they don't help players step back and identify patterns across time. I wanted answers like:</p>
                    
                    <div class="problem-questions">
                        <div class="question-item">
                            <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i>
                            <p>Which openings was I overusing?</p>
                        </div>

                            <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i>
                            <p>Did I struggle more against certain rating brackets?</p>

                        <div class="question-item">
                            <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i>
                            <p>Was my decision quality better in longer games or faster time controls?</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="question-item">
                            <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i>
                            <p>How often did I blunder when I had less than one minute on the clock?</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The only way to answer these questions was to collect all my games, clean and structure the data, and start digging in. At first, I did this manually—exporting my PGN files and reviewing them in Excel. But the process was tedious and slow. I knew there had to be a better way, and that's when I decided to automate the entire pipeline.</p>

                <div class="project-section story-section">
                    <h2>Designing the System: From PGN to Dashboard</h2>
                    <p>To make ChessLytics scalable, I had to build a system that could process thousands of games across multiple users, while keeping it efficient and secure. Here's how I approached it:</p>
                    
                    <div class="system-design-grid">
                        <div class="design-item">
                            <h3><i class="fas fa-download"></i> Data Ingestion</h3>
                            <p>Chess.com provides a comprehensive REST API that allows access to player data and game histories. I built automated scripts to fetch player profiles, monthly game archives, and detailed game information using Python's requests library with proper rate limiting and error handling.</p>
                            <p>For user-specific data, I created functionality for people to input their Chess.com username and year, which would trigger the system to collect and process their entire game history automatically.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="design-item">
                            <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Data Processing with Python</h3>
                            <p>Once the raw data was ingested, I used Python with Pandas and NumPy to parse and transform the files. PGN (Portable Game Notation) is a structured format, but it still requires custom parsing to extract metadata like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Opening name and ECO code</li>
                                <li>Move-by-move timestamps and time controls</li>
                                <li>Game duration, result, and rating changes</li>
                                <li>Special moves like castling, en passant, and promotions</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Using Python allowed me to process the data efficiently while maintaining flexibility for complex chess-specific calculations.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="design-item">
                            <h3><i class="fas fa-database"></i> Storage and Analytics</h3>
                            <p>Processed data was pushed into Google BigQuery, which allowed me to run complex SQL analytics at scale. For example, I could quickly compute player win rates per opening, track average performance over time, and compare results by time control or rating bracket.</p>
                            <p>I used Looker Studio to build interactive dashboards, both for global trends and for user-specific insights. Users could input their username and receive a full performance breakdown within minutes.</p>

The frontend allowed users to input their Chess.com username, trigger their personalized analysis, and interact with 20+ different charts and visualizations. The entire process—from raw data collection to visual insights—was streamlined and automated.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned from the Data</h2>
                    <p>With the system in place, I started to see fascinating trends—both in my own gameplay and across users.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, I discovered that I was frequently making mistakes in the same late-midgame positions when under time pressure. My accuracy dropped significantly after move 25, especially when I had less than two minutes on the clock. That insight alone helped me improve my time management and focus in endgames.</p>
                    
                    <p>Other users shared similar feedback. Some found that they played too passively with the black pieces, while others were overusing risky openings without realizing how poor their results were. I even built analytics that looked at rating volatility and performance after losses, helping players understand how emotion was affecting their decision-making.</p>
                    
                    <p>These patterns made the experience feel incredibly rewarding. I wasn't just building charts—I was helping people see themselves more clearly.</p>

                    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                    <p>ChessLytics was never just about chess—it was about learning how to build something that matters. It taught me how to work with data from end to end: ingestion, transformation, analysis, visualization, and user feedback.</p>
                    
                    <p>But more than that, it taught me to think like a systems designer. Every feature I added had to balance performance, usability, and accuracy. Every insight I surfaced had to be statistically sound and meaningful. And every line of code I wrote had to scale.</p>
                    
                    <p>These are the same skills I hope to bring into future work, especially in environments where data is critical to making informed, high-stakes decisions—whether it's in finance, health, or national security.</p>

                <div class="project-section story-section">
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>ChessLytics started as a tool to help me stop losing chess games. But in the end, it taught me how to think like a data engineer. It challenged me to design scalable systems, analyze complex behavior, and build tools that people actually use.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most importantly, it taught me that data is never just numbers—it's a reflection of people, patterns, and decisions. And when used responsibly, it can be a powerful tool for understanding the world and making it better.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's the mindset I carry into every data project I take on, and one I'm excited to bring to the next chapter of my career.</p>
