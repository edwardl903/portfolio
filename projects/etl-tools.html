                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>At Fidelity Investments, I led a comprehensive user behavior analysis for the PB Optimize platform - a valuable tool for institutional investors. The platform offered great features, but I needed to understand how users were actually engaging with it to prioritize improvements that would deliver the most value. <em>Note: Due to NDA restrictions, specific details about the analysis and findings are limited.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>I started by analyzing usage analytics to identify which features were getting the most traffic and where users were dropping off. I also sat down with Fidelity's Customer Success team to understand the client perspective - what were their pain points and what features did they actually need?</p>
                    
                    <p>From there, I experimented with different visualization tools. I tried both Google Looker and Power BI to see which would work best for our needs, and I also created some custom visualizations using Python and Excel to really dig into the user behavior patterns.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>The main thing I delivered was a set of interactive dashboards that showed exactly how users were moving through the platform. I built these in both Google Looker and Power BI to see which worked better, and I also created some custom Python and Excel visualizations to really get into the details.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also put together some visual flow diagrams in Figma that showed the most common paths users take through the platform. This helped the product team see where users were getting stuck and where the experience was working well.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>I looked at everything from basic user tracking (who was using what, when) to more complex stuff like how long pages took to load and what devices people were using. I also dug into the patterns - like what time of day people were most active, and which features they tended to use together.</p>
                    
                    <p>The dashboards I built covered all the key metrics: total sessions, how interactive different pages were, what kind of users we had, and the flow of how people moved through the platform. I made sure to include both the high-level overview and the detailed breakdowns so different stakeholders could find what they needed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-section">
                    <p>This project really changed how the team thought about the platform. Instead of making decisions based on assumptions, we now had real data showing exactly how users were behaving. The dashboards helped everyone from product managers to customer success understand what was working and what needed improvement.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most importantly, it helped us identify which features were actually valuable to users versus which ones just looked good on paper. We also found some bottlenecks in the user experience that we wouldn't have spotted otherwise. The customer success team especially appreciated having concrete data to back up their conversations with clients.</p>
