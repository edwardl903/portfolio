                    <h2>My Chess Journey</h2>
                    <p>I learned chess from my older brother when I was 8, but it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 that I truly became interested in the game. What started as a way to pass time during lockdown evolved into a serious passion that has shaped my strategic thinking and leadership skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm proud of my current <strong>2200 chess.com rapid rating</strong>, with <strong>2000 in blitz</strong> and <strong>2000 in bullet</strong>. You can check out my games and progress on my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/EdwardL903" target="_blank" class="chess-link">chess.com profile</a>.</p>

                    <p>My passion for chess extends beyond playing - I've had the privilege of teaching numerous programs at my local community center, my high school, and various camps around the Massachusetts area. I believe in giving back to the chess community and helping others discover the beauty of the game.</p>

                    <p>I was the <strong>founder of Tufts Chess Club</strong> and served as <strong>acting president from 2021-2025</strong>. During my time leading the club, I also had the honor of being the <strong>captain of Tufts Collegiate Team A</strong>, competing against other colleges in chess tournaments. These experiences taught me valuable leadership and organizational skills.</p>

                    <p>My passion for chess led me to create <strong>ChessLytics</strong>, an end-to-end chess analytics platform that processes 100,000+ games. This project combines my love for chess with my data engineering skills, providing personalized insights and analytics for chess players.</p>
