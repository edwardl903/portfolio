                    <h2>My Volleyball Journey</h2>
                    <p>My volleyball journey began when I was 12 years old, when my mom taught me how to play. I would actively play with her and her friends, developing a love for the sport that would grow into a lifelong passion.</p>
                    
                    <p>In high school, I joined the freshman team as JV and quickly progressed to varsity the following year. During this time, I also played club volleyball, competing all over the New England area. My dedication and leadership skills were recognized when I became captain of my varsity team in my senior year.</p>
                    
                    <p>I continued my love for volleyball into college, where I played on the Tufts Men's Volleyball Club Team as a DS/Libero. I love playing both recreationally and competitively, and I'm always willing to teach another person how to play.</p>

                                    <h4>Pancake Save - Tufts Men's Volleyball Club Team</h4>
                                    <p>A highlight from casual volleyball with the Tufts Men's Volleyball Club Team. In this clip, you can see me executing a "pancake" - when I dive to the ground and put my hand flat (like a pancake) under the ball right before it hits the floor. It's like making a "table" with your hand to bounce the ball back up so my teammates can keep playing. This is one of the most exciting defensive moves in volleyball!</p>
